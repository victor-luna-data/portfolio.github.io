                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Victor Luna. Data & AI Engineer with experience in designing and implementing end-to-end data and advanced analytics solutions in the cloud. Specialized in data engineering, statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning models. 
                    <br>
                     I have worked in collaborative environments alongside data scientists and data engineers, participating in the construction of scalable pipelines, ETL/ELT processes, data validation, and the generation of actionable insights for the business. I have experience integrating data from APIs, databases, and enterprise systems (SAP, Oracle), as well as in the development of analytical projects oriented towards real-world cases.
                    <br>
                     I have an analytical mindset, a focus on data quality and automation, and a keen interest in solutions that integrate Data Engineering + AI to enable data-driven decision making.
